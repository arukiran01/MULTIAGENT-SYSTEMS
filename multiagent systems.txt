Slide 2: Introduction to Multiagent Systems
Definition: A system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents.
Purpose: To achieve a common goal or solve problems that are beyond the capability of a single agent.
Slide 3: Basic Principles of Multiagent Systems
Autonomy: Each agent operates independently.

Social Ability: Agents can interact with each other.

Communication: Agents exchange information to coordinate actions.

Slide 4: Typical Structure of a Multiagent System
Agents: Autonomous entities capable of acting on their own.

Environment: The context in which agents operate.

Interactions: How agents communicate and influence each other.

Communication: Mechanisms for information exchange.

Influence on Environment: Agents can change the environment.

Organizations: Agents can form groups or communities.

Hierarchical Structures: Some agents may have control over others.

Slide 5: Multiagent Architectures
Distributed: No central control.

Decentralized: Each agent makes decisions based on local information.

Hierarchical: Some agents have control over others.

Slide 6: Agent Types
Autonomous: Makes decisions on its own.

Cooperative: Works together with other agents.

Competitive: Works against other agents.

Hybrid: Combines different types of behaviors.

Slide 7: Lifecycle Management
Creation: How agents are brought into the system.

Execution: How agents perform their tasks.

Termination: How agents are removed from the system.

Slide 8: Consistency and Coordination
Consistency: Ensuring that agents' actions are aligned with the system's goals.
Coordination: Managing interactions between agents to avoid conflicts.
Slide 9: Applications of Multiagent Systems
Service-Based Systems: Agents provide services to users.

Manufacturing: Agents control manufacturing processes.

Spacecraft Control: Agents manage spacecraft operations.
